Design Decisions

  We started by implementing the symbol table we created from p3. Then we gave each 
  node item an Emit function which would call the appropriate methods in the code generator
  class to create the correct TAC instructions. Each Emit function would also call it's 
  children's Emit functions until all code has been generated. FnDecl's keep track of the 
  amount of variables created by their Emit functions so that they can instruct the TAC
  generator how much stack space to allocate.

Error Handling

  If any errors are discovered in the code that are not part of the p3 error cases the correct
  ReportError function will be called. For example if you do not define a main function then 
  dcc will print the NoMainFound() error message.
