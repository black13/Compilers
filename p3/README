Design Decisions

  Initially we designed the symbol table to be a pure stack. But after realizing
  that would not work we redesigned it to be more of a tree-like structure.
  We modeled our check functions after the print function from P2 with check()
  and checkChildren().

Error Handling
  
  We make at least 3 passes over the AST so that we can identify errors in the 
  correct order. For some errors we will make many passes over the same section
  so that we can correctly match the expected output.
