Design Decisions

  The scanner was designed to be as simple as possible.
  It keeps track of both the current line and char it is parsing with the 
  num_lines and num_chars variables. Both variales are updated on the 
  DoBeforeEachAction method which is called for each identifier,
  Whitespace is ignored, but newlines will increment the num_lines variable.
  When the start of a multi-line comment is found the only rule that wil remove
  the scanner from parsing a comment is the end-comment identifier.
  Keywords and operations return the cirrect values as defines in the provided 
  header files.
  Values are parsed into the correct Dcaf types.
    Ints use atoi and strtoul for hex
    Doubles use atof
  An additional function foundIdent was created to handle copying over
  identifiers. It will also check the length and if it is over MaxIdentLen then
  it will report the error.

Error Handling

  The scanner will call the correct method in the ReportError class if it detects
  one of the following Decaf errors:
    Unterminated Comment
    Unterminated String
    Unrecognized Character
    Identifier over MaxIdentLen long
